You can add a username to the file using this command. We are using sammy as our username, but you can use whatever name youâ€™d like:

sudo sh -c "echo -n 'sammy:' >> /etc/nginx/.htpasswd"


Next, add an encrypted password entry for the username by typing:

sudo sh -c "openssl passwd -apr1 >> /etc/nginx/.htpasswd"
